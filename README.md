# 🏡 House Price Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts California house prices based on various housing and demographic features. This project demonstrates the full data science pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** [California Housing Prices Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)
- Includes features such as location, number of rooms, population, and ocean proximity, with the goal of predicting median house values.

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Data cleaning, handling missing values
- Feature scaling and one-hot encoding
- Custom feature engineering (e.g., bedroom-to-room ratio, rooms per household)
- Trained models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Evaluated models using R² score

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Model Performance

- Achieved **80%+ R² Score** using a tuned Random Forest Regressor with scaled features.
